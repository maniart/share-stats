Not a half-hour later, the family was being rushed to the hospital after a violent altercation with local police.</p>
</div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The incident started so small. When one child didn’t have swimming trunks, staff demanded the family leave.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Even though Dixon, pregnant and 33, said she had a swimsuit for the child, workers at the Fairfield Aquatic Center—about 25 miles north of Cincinnati—said it was too late.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>What was a minor breach of pool rules then descended into chaos: A white officer using pepper spray on black teenage girls, and one 12-year-old—Dixon’s niece—being slammed against a cop car. Her family says she has a fractured jaw and broken ribs.</p>
</div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Two adults were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. A 12-year-old girl was charged with assault and resisting arrest, while a 15-year-old was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.</p>
</div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The two sides paint a different picture of what happened. The family is accusing the cops of using excessive force in the incident. The police say they were just doing their jobs—and besides, the 12-year-old attacked them. But a 911 call by a pool employee reveals concerns over race.</p>

Bishop Bobby Hilton, a Cincinnati pastor who belongs to the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, came forward to present photos of the injured kids.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>“They’re saying a 12-year-old was assaulting somebody and resisting being arrested,” Hilton told The Daily Beast. “Please tell me, where is she assaulting somebody? Why did the officer have to grab her by the neck and push her against the car? It’s just not right.”</p></div><div class="wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/pullquote"><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“Tell me, where is she assaulting somebody? Why did the officer have to grab her by the neck and push her against the car? It’s just not right.”</p></blockquote></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Clyde Bennett, an attorney for Dixon, added: “I could surmise or opine on why [pool staff] wanted them out. They said they’re not appropriately dressed. I’m not convinced that’s why they wanted them out of the pool.”</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>“There’s a lot of people in Cincinnati who believe they wanted them out … because they were black,” Bennett added.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Dixon’s family says it’s the latest example of police using excessive force against black teens. Days before, an officer was captured on video <a href="/cheats/2015/06/07/tx-cop-suspended-for-pulling-gun-at-pool.html">pulling a gun at a pool party in McKinney, Texas</a>, and slamming a black girl to the ground. The <a href="/cheats/2015/06/10/mckinney-cop-eric-casebolt.html">cop resigned</a> and his attorney said “he was not targeting minorities.”</p>
</div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>A video of the Fairfield melee wasn’t nearly as <a href="/articles/2015/06/08/the-invisible-white-man-in-mckinney.html">shocking as the McKinney footage</a>. But the altercation was serious. After the Fairfield incident, the six-months-pregnant Dixon was rushed to the hospital for evaluation with four other relatives—including the 12-year-old with fractured bones. (The Daily Beast is not naming her, or any other juvenile, from this incident.) Another girl had to get her eyes rinsed out. Dixon was not injured, but she’s facing disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges.</p>
</div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>“Krystal Dixon was behaving in a lawful manner,” Bennett told The Daily Beast. “When you’re not doing anything illegal or unlawful you should not be subject to arrest.”</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>“You’ve got a six-months pregnant woman trying to get her kids out of the pool, and before she could do that she was arrested,” he added.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Dixon said she brought eight children to the pool at about 3 p.m. and left to pick up her sister, who also planned to spend the day there. One of her nephews didn’t have swimming trunks on and was told to leave.</p>
</div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Three kids went into the pool, but the others called Dixon, who said she’d be back in 10 minutes with the missing swimsuit. When she arrived, staff told her the kid without the trunks broke the rules by swimming in his clothes.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Staff then told her the teens still had to leave because of how they behaved when workers informed them of the rules breach.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The mom decided to get the other kids and go. That’s when, according to Dixon, a park ranger followed her. When the teens came over to see what’s going on, the ranger took out handcuffs.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The ranger said they’d be arrested if they didn’t leave. He asks for Dixon’s ID, which she doesn’t have on her, then grabs her arm. The children ask the officer to let Dixon go, and the scene escalates.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The footage shows a group of officers trying to apprehend several teenagers at the scene. A random white civilian is pictured pushing up against a black teen in handcuffs. One teen girl is crying on the ground after being pepper sprayed. Another girl is crying as a cop grabs the back of her neck and pushes her into a squad car.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The family claims they didn’t do anything wrong. Police provide a vastly different account.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>“They refused to leave and became even more verbally aggressive and belligerent,” Fairfield police officer Doug Day told The Daily Beast.</p></div><div class="wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/inlineimage"><figure class="image"><img class="tablet" data-original="http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/06/16/white-cop-grabs-black-tween-by-her-neck-and-slams-her-against-his-squad-car/jcr:content/body/inlineimage.img.1280.1024.jpg/1434546499304.cached.jpg" src="/etc/clientlibs/mobilebeast2/img/placeholder/nophoto-16-9.jpg.dimg.1280.720.jpg/0.cached.jpg"/><img class="mobile" data-original="http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/06/16/white-cop-grabs-black-tween-by-her-neck-and-slams-her-against-his-squad-car/jcr:content/body/inlineimage.img.500.333.jpg/1434546499304.cached.jpg" src="/etc/clientlibs/mobilebeast2/img/placeholder/nophoto.jpg.dimg.500.333.jpg/0.cached.jpg"/><div class="gradient"></div><div class="credits"><span class="js-toggle-info-icon background-gradient"><span class="icon-info"></span></span><span class="content js-toggle-credit">Handout</span></div></figure></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>When the park ranger put his hand on Dixon, the children and Dixon’s sister “started jumping on the park ranger’s back,” Day said, adding that the injured 12-year-old was striking and pushing one of the officers.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Police say they weren’t informed of any injuries until after Tuesday’s press conference and denied the family’s claims of excessive force.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>“Our officers used great restraint,” Day said. “At one point, one of our officers felt his gun was being taken away from him.

Those bonds are so tight that all three have been sanctioned in the last year by both the United States and European Union for their role as state organs of Russian foreign policy and, by extension, their complicity in the invasion and occupation of Ukraine.
